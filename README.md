# Lessons from CEO's: Analyzing the Text from the New York Times Corner Office Column in R

This repo is an extension of a previous project found at . The goal of the previous project was to provide tools to social science researchers to extract topics from a small number of interview transcripts. I used transcripts from the New York Times Corner Office Column for test data. I was curious about what an analysis of all the New York Times Corner Office Column articles would look like. Thus, the inspiration from this project. Steps included:

1. Using the NYT API to get the URL's for Corner Office articles (451 out of the 525 published articles)
2. Using these URL's to obtain the content of the articles (not available directly from the API)
3. Cleaning the transcripts such that the interview questions were removed and each response was coded as an individual document
4. Cleaning the text data
5. Producing a word cloud of the most frequent words
6. Using LDA to identify common topics and visualizing the topics in an interactive tree
7. An R-Shiny app to display CEO quotes that include the most common word ('people')

## Project Steps

The following steps will allow you to replicate the analysis on your computer. Alternatively, you can change the search terms in the NYT API to use this same analysis for different keywords.

### Prerequisites

Before initiating this project, you will need to aquire a NYT API key https://developer.nytimes.com/signup and install the following R libraries:

```
#Please load the following libraries
library(XML)
library(rtimes)
library(stringr)
library(tm)
library(httr)
library(topicmodels)
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(quanteda)
library(wordcloud2)
library(collapsibleTree)
library(shiny)
library(htmlwidgets)

#Set the following NYT Key:
Sys.setenv(NYTIMES_AS_KEY = "Your NYT Key")
```

### Obtaining Article Data

Data for all articles were obtained from the NYT Search API. Note key limitations of the NYT Search API: 
* The API returns information (including URLs) in groups of 10
* Maximum of 1000 requests per day 
* Must be 1 second between requests. 

The key variables in this loop:
1. (i in 0:73) tells the loop to start at Page 0 and go to Page 73. Each page produces data 10 articles, so there are 730 total articles. 73 was chosen as no other articles were produced in this search beyond Page 73; it should be modified for searches with different key words.
2. Sys.sleep(1) allows the API to function
3. The key terms "corner office" and "adam bryant" were used to search the title, author, and text body
4. The '20090701' and '20171025' are the start and end dates respectively for the Corner Office column

```
urllist<-c()
urls <- c()
mainhead <-c()
headline <- c()
subhead <- c()
sublabel <- c()
dpub <- c()
datepub <- c()
i=0
for (i in 0:73){
  Sys.sleep(1)
  cornerarticles <- as_search(q="corner office adam bryant",start_date ='20090701', end_date = '20171025',page=i)
  urllist <- cornerarticles$data$web_url
  print(length(urllist))
  urls <- c(urls,urllist)
  mainhead <-cornerarticles$data$headline.main
  headline <- c(headline,mainhead)
  subhead <- cornerarticles$data$headline.kicker
  sublabel <- c(sublabel,subhead)
  dpub <- cornerarticles$data$pub_date
  datepub <- c(datepub,dpub)
}
```

This search selects any article that includes these key words, including articles that are not actually in the Corner Office column. The following code limits the articles to only those published by Adam Bryant in the Corner Office column. Note that Adam Bryant wrote that he had completed 525 Corner Office Interviews, but only 451 came up through the search.

```
#Selecting only those articles from the Corner Office blog
alldata <-  data.frame(urls,headline,sublabel,datepub)
corneroffice <- subset(alldata,sublabel=="Corner Office")
```

To separate the urls, headlines, and publication dates, run the following:

```
#Separating relevant information (namely URL, headline, and publication date)
cornerofficeurls <- as.character(corneroffice$urls)
cornerofficeheads <- as.character(corneroffice$headline)
cornerofficedates <- as.character(corneroffice$datepub)
```
